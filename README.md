# **Project Name**:  

React Game: Tic-Tac-Toe

# **Description**: 

The React Game: Tic-Tac-Toe project is a simple game. The game is won by marking a line of 3 (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) squares in a row by the same player. The fastest this game can be won in is on the fifth turn. The two players are indicated by a red X and a white O.

The React Game: Tic-Tac-Toe project is an example of my ability to create a React app, employ Babel transpiler, and my JSX, Javascript, HTML5, and css coding capabilities, and as such, it is one component of my professional portfolio. This particular project is based off of similar activities I worked on in August of 2023 in module 15 of the MIT xPro via Emeritus bootcamp I was enrolled in called "Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN."

# **Installation and Usage**: 

To run my project on your machine, download the files onto your machine or clone the repo. Navigate to the project directory in terminal. Install the necessary dependencies by typing the command prompt: npm install. Start the server by typing the command prompt: npm start.

If you are having issues, ensure the version of Node.js you are using is compatible.


# **Dependencies**: 

The project relies on the following dependencies: React, Bootstrap, Babel

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# **Roadmap**: 

Future fixes or improvements that would be helpful to a user:

* Currently the color of the letter (player X or O) changes color when a square is marked. Specifically when it player X marks the board, the X appears in red and the O appears in white. An improvement would be for the color of the square (not the letter) to change. 

* Currently when a winner is declared, play can still continue. An improvement would be to prevent the next player from marking the board once a winner has been declared.

* Another improvement would be to prevent player X from being able to mark a square that player O already marked, and vice versa.

* Currently when the {status} of WINNER is declared at the bottom of the screen, it does not stand out. An improvement would be to make the winner status more obvious becuase it is barely noticable now when a winner has been declared. Possible improvements include:
- larger font
- flashing font 
- font that standouts more against the background color
- create a rectangle with a standout background color and a border, in which the winner status fills.
